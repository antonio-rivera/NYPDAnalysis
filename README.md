# NYPD Analysis
### Antonio J. Rivera Lopez

This is the NYPD data analysis done through R that I did for my course on
Data Science as a field for the University of Colorado Boulder. In the 
files you should see a file titled "NYPD.Rmd" that contains the reproducible R markdown file.
The only requirements for the R markdown are the libraries:
- tidyverse
- lubridate

and an internet connection to read the csv data from the url.
